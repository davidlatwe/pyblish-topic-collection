## Preparation for upcoming extensions and integrations

* [Writing Extensions](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish/wiki/Writing-Extensions)
* [Writing Integrations](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish/wiki/Writing-Integrations)

The goal is for each extension to follow an identical pattern, and the currently available ones may be used as reference.
