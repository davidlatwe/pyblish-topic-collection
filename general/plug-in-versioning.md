## Versioning

[issue #118](https://github.com/pyblish/pyblish-base/issues/118)

When we make a change to the backend (Pyblish-base API), all plugins could potentially stop working, because they no longer match the interface provided by their superclass.

This should be okay, but at the moment there isnâ€™t any way for such events to fail gracefully.

Adding a `requires` attribute, next to `families` and `version` in the superclass for plugins for them to specify with which version of Pyblish they are compatible with.

```python
# superclass
class Plugin():
    hosts = ["*"]
    families = ["*"]
    order = -1
    requires = "pyblish>=1"
```

See here for an example implementation in Rez.
